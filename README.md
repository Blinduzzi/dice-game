# dice-game
Trained a DQN agent to play the dice game described in the MathWorks course RL Onramp as part of my Smart Optical Networks uni course

https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/reinforcement-learning-onramp/reinforcementlearning

The goal is to choose suitable dices (which have different faces) in order to subtract the random rolled 
number from the total amount (starting from 20) and reach 0. The main function is "dice.mlx" .
